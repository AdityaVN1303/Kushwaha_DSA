--- Java Introduction ---



--- How Java Code Executes ? ---

.java file (human readable)
|
compiler (entire file)
|
.class file (byte code)
|
interpreter (line by line)
|
Machine Code (0,1)


1. Compiler converts human readable code to byte code (language of java , needs jvm to run this)
2. Interpreter converts byte code to machine code line by line 
In C++ , the middle step (conversion into byte code) is skipped. 

----------


--- What is Platform Independence ? ---

- It means that byte code can run on all operating systems.
- We need to convert source code into machine code so computer can understand
- Compiler helps in doing this by turning it into executable code
- This executable code is a set of instructions for the computer.
- After compiling C/C++ code we get .exe file which is platform dependent 
- In Java , we get bytecode , JVM converts this to machine code.
- Java os platform - independent but JVM is platform Dependent.

--- JDK vs JRE vs JVM vs JIT ---

JDK = JRE + other development tools
JRE = JVM + Library Classes
JVM = JIT

----------




JDK ---> 
- Provides environment to develop and run the java program
- It is a package that includes -
1. Development tools --- to provide an environment to develop your program
2. JRE - to execute your program
3. a compiler - javac
4. archiver - jar
5. docs generator - javadoc
6. interpretor / loader

JRE --->
- It is a installation package that provides environment to only run the program
- It consists of ->
1. Deployment Technologies
2. User Interface Toolkits 
3. Integration Libraries
4. Base Libraries 
5. jvm
- After we get the .class file , next things happens at runtime. 
1. Class loader loads all classes needed to execute the program. 
2. JVM sends code to byte code verifier to check the format of the code. 

JVM --->
Interpreter :
- Line by Line Execution
- When one method is called many times , it will interpret again and again

JIT ---> 
- Those methods that are repeated , JIT provides direct machine code so re-interpretation is not required. 
- Makes execution faster. 
- Garbage Collector

--- JRE vs JVM ---
- JRE is a box consisting of JVM + Other extra files required for the JVM for execution of the code. 
- When JVM needs any help , it asks JRE like asking for any file or library.
